# Getting Started with Django store Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode with .env variable `REACT_CHECKOUT_DEVELOPMENT=True`\

You will need to refresh your page manually after you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Built scripts and css are copied to django static folder: `app/static/reactjs/`.\
Make sure `REACT_CHECKOUT_DEVELOPMENT=False` to test out the built script
